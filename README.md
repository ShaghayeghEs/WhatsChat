WhatsChat is a chat client & server program implemented using Node.js platform. The most important feature of the chat program is being realtime and obviously bidirectional event-based communication. That is to say, there is no AJAX in play. Every event is reported to server realtime, so there is no delay between the occurrence of an event and notifying users.
